# Geocast


## Description/Motivation
* Our goal was to create web page that will allow commuters to search for podcasts and playlists that will be match their commute times. Our app utilizes two APIs to search for content based upon a userâ€™s input. The user can search for content based on preferences and commute time, so that they can listen to a complete podcast or playlist that will fit their commute.

## Installation

## Usage
This web page consists of one user interface, which is comprised of two sections: an area where the user can input the requested criteria (i.e., commute time and topic of interest[possible?]) and an area where results generated via the APIs will be displayed.
After opening the web page, the user should navigate to the user input fields and input their commute time and a topic of interest. Once the two input fields have been filled out, the user can click on the submit button to retrieve results from the APIs. In a few seconds, podcast and/or playlist options will populate in the display area, and the user can select a podcast or playlist that appeals to them.
If the user would like to receive different results, or results that match different search criteria, they can delete the information in the input fields from their initial search and input new information.
