# Astro-mixologist


## Description/Motivation
Do you place credence in the stars? Have you been itching to know what your zodiac sign is and learn more about your horoscope? Our goal for this application was to allow users to input their date of birth to identify their zodiac sign and receive a horoscope. Moreover, our application serves as a mixologist in that, alongside the user's zodiac information and horoscope, it will also provide several tailored drink suggestions based on the user's zodiac sign. Have you ever wondered what all the Capricorns are drinking? Should a Scorpio order a mojito or a whiskey on the rocks? What about an Aquarius? Whose caipirinha is that? Your significant other is a Sagittarius, take a look at some drink recommendations!  

Our app utilizes three APIs to search for content based upon a userâ€™s input criteria: TheCocktailDB, via which we can extract information pertaining to drinks; Zodiac Sign API, which returns the astrological zodiac sign for a given date; and Aztro., which provides daily horoscopes and detailed information for each sign. As mentioned above, by way of these APIs, our app enables the user to search for content based on date of birth, allowing them to locate their zodiac sign, personal horoscope, and tailored drink suggestions.

## Usage
This web page consists of one user interface, which is comprised of three sections: an area where the user can select specific criteria (i.e., date of birth) and two areas where results generated via the APIs will be apended and displayed.

After opening the web page, the user should navigate to the dropdown menu, located on the left side of the web page, and select the range in which their date of birth falls.

Once the range has been selected, the user can click on the submit button to retrieve results from the APIs. In a few seconds, your zodiac sign will be displayed alongside the user's horoscope and tailored drink suggestions.The user can then select a drink that appeals to them. Cheers!

If the user would like to receive different results - or results that match different search criteria - they can do so by selecting a different date range and clicking on the submit button.

## Tech Used
This web page was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding languages. Additionally, our team utilized BULMA - a public CSS library - to create a more aesthetically pleasing interface for the user. Moreover, our team made use of Kanban to create, delegate, and manage tasks for this project. During the initial steps of the project, we used a wire-framing tool to create a blueprint for the web page, which helped us visualize and create a structural layout.
