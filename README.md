## Description/Motivation
In the modern world, an increasing amount of people commute to work by - among other methods of transportation - car, public transportation, and bicylce. To fill the time spent commuting to and from work, many of these individuals choose to listen to podcasts or music. Our intention with this project was to create a web page that enables said commuters to search for podcasts and playlists that match their commute times AND personal interests. That way, they will be able to enjoy their commutes to work and remain abreast of current issues.

Our app utilizes two APIs to search for content based upon a userâ€™s input criteria: Spotify's API, via which we extracts information pertaining to podcasts and playlists, as well as Google Maps' API, which allows us access to information on maps and travel times. As mentioned above, our app enables the user to search for content based on topics of interest and commute time, allowing them to find a tailored podcast or playlists that suits their personal interests and situation.

## Installation
To access the web page, click on the following link: (Insert link here). If you have successfully reached the web page, you will see the following landing page:

## Usage
This web page consists of one user interface, which is comprised of two sections: an area where the user can input the specific criteria (i.e., commute time and topic of interest) and an area where results generated via the APIs will be displayed.

After opening the web page, the user should navigate to the user input fields, located on the left side of the web page, and input their commute time and a topic of interest. Once the two input fields have been filled out, the user can click on the submit button to retrieve results from the APIs. In a few seconds, tailored podcast and/or playlist suggestions will populate in the display area, and the user can then select a podcast or playlist that appeals to them.

If the user would like to receive different results - or results that match different search criteria - they can do so by deleting the information in the input fields from their initial search and input new information.

## Tech Used
This web page was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding languages. Additionally, our team utilized BULMA, a public CSS library - to create a more aesthetically pleasing interface for the user. During the initial steps of the project, we used a wire-framing tool to create a blueprint for the web page, which helped us visualize and create a structural layout (see image below).

Finally, our web page would not be complete without the APIs that we used. Specifically, we used the Spotify API and the Google Maps API.
